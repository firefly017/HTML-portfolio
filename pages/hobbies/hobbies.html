      <p>
        For a person who is slightly on the introverted side, I have quite a lot
        of hobbies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Indoor planting</b></li>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love plants, and I have more than fifty houseplants
        in my livingroom. you might think that I am crazy, but I talk to my
        plants.
        <li><b>Reading</b></li>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I read as if I am breathing oxyzen. Reading is one of
        the hobbies that I picked up in my childhood and it stayed with me
        <li><b>Travelling</b></li>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gypsy is what they call me, for I am a globetrotter.
        I want to travel the whole world before I die.
        <li><b>Kickboxing</b></li>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a comperatively new hobby that I picked up
        only a few months ago, but it makes a lazy person like me sweat with a
        grin on the face.
